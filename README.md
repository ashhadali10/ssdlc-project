üöÄ Secure MERN Application for SSDLCP

‚ÑπÔ∏è This project is a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) application designed to practice Secure Software Development Lifecycle Practices (SSDLCP). Initially, the application intentionally demonstrates various OWASP Top 10 security issues.

üõ°Ô∏è Objective

The primary goal is to simulate and address common security vulnerabilities such as XSS, SQL Injection, CSRF, SSRF, and Input Validation Issues. This application serves as a controlled environment for learning about these vulnerabilities.

‚ú® Features

Vulnerable Implementation: Demonstrates initial OWASP vulnerabilities.
Secure Coding Practice: Implements secure coding practices to mitigate vulnerabilities.
OWASP Compliance: Adheres to OWASP guidelines and best practices.
MongoDB Database: Utilizes MongoDB for data storage.
üîß Technologies

Frontend: Built with React.js for the user interface.
Backend: Powered by Node.js and Express for server-side logic.
Database: MongoDB handles data storage.
Security: Follows OWASP guidelines for secure development.
üîí Security Enhancements

Gradually secures vulnerable aspects using industry-standard practices, ensuring robust security measures against potential threats.

üìö Usage

Clone the repository, follow setup instructions to explore vulnerabilities, implement fixes, and learn secure coding practices.
