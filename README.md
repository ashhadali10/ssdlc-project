üöÄ Secure MERN Application for SSDLCP

‚ÑπÔ∏è This project is a simple MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) application developed for Secure Software Development Lifecycle Practice (SSDLCP). Initially, the application is intentionally vulnerable, demonstrating various OWASP Top 10 security issues.

üõ°Ô∏è Objective
The primary goal is to simulate and address common security vulnerabilities such as XSS, SQL Injection, CSRF, SSRF, Input Validation Issues, and more. The application serves as a learning platform to understand these vulnerabilities in a controlled environment.

‚ú® Features

Vulnerable Implementation: Initially, the application showcases OWASP vulnerabilities.
Secure Coding Practice: Implementing secure coding practices to mitigate vulnerabilities.
OWASP Compliance: Ensuring adherence to OWASP guidelines and best practices.
MongoDB Database: Utilizes MongoDB for data storage.
üîß Technologies

Frontend: React.js for the user interface.
Backend: Node.js and Express for server-side logic.
Database: MongoDB for data storage.
Security: OWASP guidelines for secure development.
üîí Security Enhancements
The vulnerable aspects are gradually secured using industry-standard practices, ensuring robust security measures are in place to protect against potential threats.

üìö Usage
Clone the repository and follow the setup instructions to explore vulnerabilities, implement fixes, and learn about secure coding practices.
